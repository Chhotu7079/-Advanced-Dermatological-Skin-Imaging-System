# 🩺 Advanced Dermatological Imaging and Early Skin Cancer Detection System

## 📌 Overview
The **Advanced Dermatological Imaging System** is a web application that uses **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning** to analyze skin lesion images and predict the **top three probable diagnoses**.  
This project aims to assist in **early detection** of skin cancer and other dermatological conditions, enabling timely medical consultation.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Upload a skin lesion image for analysis  
- ✅ Deep Learning model predicts and displays **top 3 probable diagnoses** with confidence scores  
- ✅ Image preprocessing and feature extraction for accurate classification  
- ✅ User-friendly interface for patients and clinicians  
- ✅ Scalable architecture for integrating with healthcare platforms

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask (or Django)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Dataset:** HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images)  
- **Deployment:** (Optional - specify if used Heroku, AWS, etc.)




📊 Dataset

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is not included in the repository.

You can download the HAM10000 dataset from Kaggle and place it inside the sc_detector/data folder.

📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Integration with cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, etc.)

🔹 Improving model accuracy with transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet)

🔹 Adding a doctor’s dashboard for case management

🔹 Mobile app integration
